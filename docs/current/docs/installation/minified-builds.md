# Minified Builds

For each of these releases on GitHub, you will usually find 2 important files:

1. A file that ends in `.min.user.js`
1. A file that ends in `.user.js`

Usually, you want to use the `.user.js` version, unless you are very concerned about bandwidth usage. The `.min.user.js` variant is functionally identical to the _full_ version, it has just been additionally run through a process to make the JS output as small as possible.

The bookmarklets advertised in the documentation also point to the minified builds, because it is assumed that bookmarklet users are not concerned with the readability of KS. If you want to get into the inner workings of KS, you're encouraged to install a userscript manager.
