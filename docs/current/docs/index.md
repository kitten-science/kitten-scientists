This website is primarily about KS, which is a userscript for [Kittens Game](https://kittensgame.com/web/), that allows you to automate most tasks in the game.

You load the script into your game through a [userscript manager or a bookmarklet](./installation/index.md) and it will create a new panel in your UI with options to configure the behavior of KS.

[Install Now](./installation/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
