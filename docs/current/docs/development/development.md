# Development Guide

!!! question

    Please help us [translate KS](https://crowdin.com/project/kitten-scientists), either by contributing missing translations or reviewing the existing entries.

## Introduction

The script is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The JS userscript itself is not intended to be edited. Changes need to be made in the [userscript source code](https://github.com/kitten-science/kitten-scientists/tree/main/packages/kitten-scientists/source) and then be compiled into the actual userscript.

The project is set up to be used with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). While other editors will work fine, some integrations have been prepared to make the development process easier.

## Prerequisites

The development environment is expected to be a POSIX-compliant system. On Windows, WSL will do fine.

You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) to be able to work with the project. The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package and project manager, which is usually integrated with recent NodeJS versions.

Additionally, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) available, to use the container-based Kittens Game development server.

## General Development

Whenever you want to see the result of your changes, use:

```shell
yarn kitten-scientists:build
```

This will [build a fresh version of the userscript](../reference/Repository%20Scripts/index.md#ksbuild). _If_ you are running a development container, this build output will also be used the next time you refresh the page.

## Development with Kittens Game Container

The development container provides a version of Kittens Game that already a Kitten Scientists version injected into it, based on your local development state.

When the container is built, it downloads the latest version of the game from <https://github.com/nuclear-unicorn/kittensgame>.

1.  Manual Refresh (recommended)

    Build the development container and start it.

    ```shell
    yarn devcontainer:run
    ```

    The script prints the URL where you can now play the game with KS installed.

    You will need to manually reload the page after each build to get the latest changes in the browser.

1.  Watcher (experimental)

    Start a watcher to continuously rebuild KS when you make code changes.

    ```shell
    yarn kitten-scientists:watch
    ```

    !!! danger

        Sadly, this behavior is known to produce broken output files. Use at your own risk and switch to manual builds as necessary.

If you ever want to [rebuild the container from scratch](../reference/Repository%20Scripts/index.md#devcontainerrebuild), for example, to pull in the _latest_ source code of KG again, run:

```shell
yarn devcontainer:rebuild
```

### Kittens Game Branch

You can run the development container on another branch of Kittens Game by providing the branch name to the `devcontainer` commands, like so:

```shell
yarn devcontainer:run dev/alpha
```

## Development without Container

To develop without containers, you can build a development version of the userscript with full debugging information.

1. Run the build script.

    ```shell
    yarn kitten-scientists:preview
    ```

    The userscript is placed in the `packages/kitten-scientists/output` directory.

## Type-Checking

To fill the **Problems** panel in VS Code with all current, type-related errors, run the [`typecheck:all`](../reference/Repository%20Scripts/index.md#typecheckall) npm task in VS Code.

## Commit Standards

KS development follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages.

Whenever possible, use one of the established scopes:

Tab related:

-   `bonfire`
-   `religion`
-   `science`
-   `space`
-   `time`
-   `trade`
-   `village`
-   `workshop`

Internals related:

-   `api`

    Relates to the global `kittenScientists` API.

-   `build`

    Relates to the process of producing one of the KS release fragment.

-   `container`

    Relates to the KS development container.

-   `core`

    Relates to central behavior of KS. Also includes state management.

-   `filters`

    Relates to the log filters of KS.

-   `i18n`

    Relates to translations of KS.

-   `settings`

    Relates to changes to the settings system.

-   `ui`

    Relates to the KS user interface.

## Pull Requests

When you open a pull request, make sure that you squash your commits into a single one, _unless_ individual commits are substantial enough that they should be preserved as-is. Just make sure that all commits follow the [commit standards](#commit-standards) mentioned above.

## Releases

### Building a Release Version of the Userscript

Run the script to build the release:

```shell
yarn kitten-scientists:release
```

### Releasing a New Version

1. Build a preview of the script:

    ```bash
    yarn kitten-scientists:preview
    ```

1. Load the built preview into a userscript manager in Chrome and perform a quick, manual test.

    1. Does the script load at all?
    1. Are settings restored to expectation?
    1. Are settings saved when they are changed?

1. Create a tag for this version:

    ```bash
    git tag v2.0.0-beta.10
    ```

1. Push the tag:

    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```

1. Raise the version number in `packages/kitten-scientists/package.json` to a **higher version that will be in development next**!

1. Make sure to also update the `README.md` to point the bookmarklet to the new script.

1. Make sure to also update the `packages/documentation/installation.md` to point to the latest version number.

1. Make sure to also update the `.github/bug_report.yml` to mention the latest version number.

1. Ultimately, search the entire project code base for the previous version string, like `2.0.0-beta.9`. Make sure to also search for `beta.9`, `beta9`, and references to _future_ releases that need to point to the new future release!

!!! note

    Don't forget to publish the drafted release on GitHub!
