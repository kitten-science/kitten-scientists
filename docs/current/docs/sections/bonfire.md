# Bonfire

## Section Trigger

This section has a trigger :material-lightning-bolt-outline: on itself. This is the _default trigger_ for the buildings in this section.

If you do not set a trigger for an individual building, that building will be triggered according to the default trigger.

## Buildings

When you enable a building, this building will be built if all of these are true:

1. Less than the limit for this building have already been built.

1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to be built are filled to the trigger level of their stock capacity.

1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to be built are sufficiently available after considering configured resource control values.

### Upgrades

Buildings with a `тод` in front of their name are upgrades to the building above them.

You can select which upgrade will be automatically purchased by enabling them under **Upgrade buildings**.
