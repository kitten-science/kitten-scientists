# Trade

When you enable a given tribe, KS will automatically trade with them, if both **Catpower** and **Gold** are filled to **Trigger** of their capacity.

## Limited Trading

When you enable **Limited** for a trade, you will only trade if the trade would be considered _profitable_.

Profitability is determined by the amount of resources you spend vs. the amount of resources you gain. The individual resources are not weighted.

## Unlimited Trading

Whenever catpower and gold are above the trigger value, instantly trigger a trade.

## Feed Leviathans

Whenever you have any **Necrocorns**, and the **Leviathans** are around, feed the necrocorns to them.

This increases the leviathans energy, which increases the amount of resources you receive from a trade with them. Beyond being a rare resource, necrocorns have no other purpose.

## Trade Blackcoin

Automatically buys **Blackcoin** when the price is below the **Buy** trigger, and automatically sells blackcoin when the price is above the **Sell** trigger.

The price of blackcoin steadily rises, until it crashes at some point. So you want to buy as long as the price climbs and is stable. When it becomes unstable and will crash soon, you want to sell.
