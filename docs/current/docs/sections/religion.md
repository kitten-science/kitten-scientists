# Religion

## Section Trigger

This section has a trigger :material-lightning-bolt-outline: on itself. This is the _default trigger_ for the buildings in this section.

If you do not set a trigger for an individual building, that building will be triggered according to the default trigger.

## Ziggurats

In general, all selected buildings are built, until their `Max` is reached.

When you enable **Build Best Unicorn Building First**, KS will evaluate which of the available buildings will provide the best return in unicorns for its cost. It will also automatically sacrifice unicorns to get the tears for the next building.

## Order of the Sun

All selected buildings are built, until their `Max` is reached.

## Cryptotheology

All selected buildings are built, until their `Max` is reached.

## Additional Options

### Sacrifice Unicorns

When you have `Trigger` amount of unicorns, sacrifice them to earn tears.

### Sacrifice Alicorns

When you have `Trigger` amount of alicorns, sacrifice them to earn time crystals.

### Refine Tears

When you have `Trigger` amount of tears, refine them into BLS.

### Refine TCs

When you have `Trigger` amount of TCs, refine them into relics.

### Transcend

Spends your epiphany to transcend, whenever that would be considered beneficial.

When you would usually only transcend at the end of a run, KS can determine during a run if transcending would allow you to regain the spent epiphany so much faster, than it would be reasonable to just do it right now during the run.

While this might seem like a way too powerful thing to automate, it is usually safe to have this enabled, to not miss a good moment to transcend.

### Adore the Galaxy

Converts your worship into epiphany, whenever you will regain `Trigger` percent of your Solar Revolution bonus with a single praise after the conversion.

!!! example

    Let's assume your current max Solar Revolution bonus would be `1000%`. If you set the trigger to `0.75`, KS would adore the galaxy, if the next Praise the Sun after that would get you back to `750%` Solar Revolution bonus.

### Praise the Sun

Converts your faith to worship, when you have filled your capacity to `Trigger` percent.
