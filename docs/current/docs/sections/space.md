## Section Trigger

This section has a trigger :material-lightning-bolt-outline: on itself. This is the _default trigger_ for the buildings in this section.

If you do not set a trigger for an individual building, that building will be triggered according to the default trigger.

## Planet Buildings

When you enable a building, this building will be built if all of these are true:

1. Less than **Max** buildings have already been built.

1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to built are filled to **Trigger** of their stock capacity.

1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to built are sufficiently available after considering configured **Stock** and **Consume**.

## Start Missions

The missions you select, will automatically be started as soon as the required materials are available.
