## kitten-scientists:release

-   Project: `@kitten-science/kitten-scientists`
-   Source:

    ```shell
    MINIFY=true vite --config vite.config.userscript.js build
    vite --config vite.config.userscript.js build
    ```

-   Description:

    Build a release version of the userscript.

    This is usually only used from CI to build both the regular version of the script, as well as a minified build. When you use this locally, it still builds both files, but clears the output directory between builds. So you end up with only the regular version.
