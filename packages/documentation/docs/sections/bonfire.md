1. Less than **Max** buildings have already been built.
1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to built are filled to **Trigger** of their stock capacity.
1. _All_ of the resources required for the building to built are sufficiently available after considering configured **Stock** and **Consume**.

### Upgrades

Buildings with a "⮤" in front of their name are upgrades to the building above them.

You can select which upgrade will be automatically purchased by enabling them under **Upgrade buildings**.
