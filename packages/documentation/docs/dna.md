# Kitten Data and Analytics

To advance in Kitten Science, we had to build more advanced technology. This page should explain this new technology.

## What is the Kitten DnA Platform?

At its core, there is a userscript, alongside KS, that can capture snapshots of data in KG. This userscript is the Kitten Analysts.

If you can run the entire Kitten Science DnA environment on your machine, this userscript can report the snapshots to a backend, which in turn can offer the data through a [Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/). The scraped data can then be observed through a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard. There should be a template in the `contrib` folder of this projects' code repository.

If you are not running the Kitten Science DnA environment, Kitten Analysts will just serve as a helper in the background to report the state of KG through a normalized interface. Other userscripts can then make decisions based on these snapshots.

## How can I use it?

!!! warning

    The current implementation expects you to have `podman` available for container networking. If you don't have it available, the command will fail and there is no alternative for now. Sorry.

Ideally, you only have to build and run the environment with two commands:

```shell
yarn kittenscience:build
yarn kittenscience:run
```

The resulting pod should expose 4 ports:

1. 7780 KGNet Interface
1. 9080 Kittens Game Browser UI
1. 9091 Prometheus Exporter
1. 9093 Kitten Analysts Websocket

Navigate to <http://localhost:9080/> to start playing with Kitten Science DnA.

## How do I get the fancy dashboards?

You need to be familiar with Prometheus and Grafana and have both already running. If you have that, you only need to scrape port `9091` on the machine that is running Kitten Science DnA.
